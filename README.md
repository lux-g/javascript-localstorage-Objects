- created and array called items, inside the array I created 3 objects storing data about products
- first set the localStorage.setItem('products', JSON.stringify(items));
- you are only able to store data as strings so we need to convert items to a string by using JSON.stringify(items)
- next lets set this to local storage by using localStorage.setItem and lets call it 'products' and pass in the variable called myProducts
- next we need to create a variable called myProducts and set it = to localStorage.getItem('products') but....
- this is now a string so we need to convert it back to a object by using JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('products'))
